# Current priorities

Priority #1 is writing webscrapers for each county, so we can collect daily jail data and dump raw html to database.
We can always work on ETL and visualization later, once we have a couple months of data.

# Project timeline

ACLU said they will start lobbying at the next GA state legislative session starting Jan 2018. Ideally we would have something useful for them at that time.
But their bail reform project will be ongoing beyond then.
