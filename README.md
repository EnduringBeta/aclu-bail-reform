# ACLU bail reform project
**Webscraping, ETL and visualization of Georgia county jail statistics.**  
To contribute see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)

## Project motivation
* [PDF](docs/ACLU-Bail-Reform-One-pager.pdf)

## Project goal
**The goal of the coding project** is to understand who is in jail where and for how long.  
We have 15 priority areas around the state. We would like to have a monthly breakdown of who is in jail by race, charge, severity (misdemeanor or felony), and length of time in jail.
We will use this data to help advocate and push for bail reform through community organizing and the legislature.

The 15 priority areas are
* Athens-Clarke
* Bibb
* Chatham
* Cobb
* Columbia/Richmond
* Dekalb
* Dougherty
* Glynn
* Gwinnett
* Hall
* Henry
* Fulton
* Lowndes
* Muscogee
* Whitfield

## How to run
* *Initial code & documentation under construction*
